## Overview:
XYZ Emoji is a Computer Vision project that is using tracking capabilities to track and overlay emojis on the user's hands!<br>
It also calculates the distance between the index finger and thumb to trigger sounds (allowing you to air drum like a rockstar! lol).<br>

## Features
In this project I've used the [MediaPipe](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/) library to track the hands and overlay emojis on them.<br>
I've also used [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) to capture the camera feed and display the results.<br>
The project also includes a sound triggering feature that allows you to trigger sounds by measuring the distance between the index finger and thumb.<br>
I've used the [Pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) library to play the sounds and the [soundfile](https://pypi.org/project/soundfile/) library to load them.<br>
